<h1>Product Reviews:</h1>
<h2>Review #1</h2>
<p>"The blender does exactly what it shows on TV. Very powerful, no more gunk build-up on the sides or remixing and re-blending. It mixes powders and ice throughly as well as frozen and fresh fruit. Who needs a juicer when
  you can blend the whole fruit up into a delicious drink? The recipes are great too! 100% worth it. I love my blender, I have had it now for over 1 year." -user Lieutenant Kitten January 2015</p>
<h2>Review #2</h2>
<p>"I've had the Vitamix for about a week now, and i am amazed with what it can do. The power behind this machine is more than I expected. I mixed a drink that included almonds, carrots, seeds, and ice cubes along with several leafy greens and whole fruits....I set it for a minute, turned it on, and within 20 seconds
  everything was liquid! No sediments on the bottom, no chunks, just a very healthy smooth mix. The device is loud, but the base is heavy and sturdy. No way this guy is tipping over. The added thermos is great too. Honestly I have not needed the tamper yet, this machine does not need help getting the ingredients
  down to the blade. Love the cookbook that comes along, so many drinks and dressings/dips I can now make myself with fresh ingredients instead of store bought bottles. Satisfied customer."-user Chriszim August 2014</p>
<h2>Review #3</h2>
<p>"This is not a normal blender, it's a high performance machine! I could not believe how powerful this thing was when I first turned it on, it actually scared me a little lol lol. I've wanted one of these vitamix blenders for a long time now and I'm glad this was on sale with payment options! You will not need another blender, food processor, juicer, or smoothie machine if you have this vitamix.
Thanks QVC and VITAMIX!!!!!!!"-user Dboff November 2013</p>
